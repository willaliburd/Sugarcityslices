*For Flaky Pastry*

    Heat oven to 400 degrees
    Blend together your shortening and margarine and divide into four parts
    Add flour, brown sugar, and one part of fat from step one and combine cutting into until mixture resembles breadcrumbs
    Slowly add cold water a little at a time until the mixture holds together.
    Roll out on a lightly floured board into a rectangular shape
    Take another part of fat from step 1 and apply it to the top 2/3 of the rolled-out pastry.
    Fold the top part of the pastry 2/3 way down.
    Fold the bottom part of the pastry over the top
    Then seal edges with the rolling pin
    Turn the dough so that the fold is now lengthwise
    Roll out again to a rectangular shape and repeat steps of applying fat to top 2/3s then folding the other side up to the top.
    Do this one more time. (Total roll and fold with fat would be three times)
    Roll out for the fourth time (do not use any fat), fold as above.
    Put the pastry on a floured sheet and cover with cling wrap and leave refrigerated for 30 to 45 minutes.
    Roll pastry out into a large oblong like shape
    Brush the inside with softened margarine
    Evenly distribute currants mixture over pastry
    Roll up pastry lengthways
    Place roll on a baking sheet with roll end at the bottom
    Place some diagonal marks on top of rolled batter (or use a fork to punch some holes)
    Place in oven and bake for approximately 20 minutes
    Remove from oven and brush roll with egg wash
    Return and bake for another 8 minutes or until golden
    Cool and slice diagonally
