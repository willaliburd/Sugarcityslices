Not destroyed by normal cooking tempereatures
Practice good personal hygiene
Prompt cleanup (use a cleanup kit - regular cleaning is not enough)

Source: human feces
Good handwashing

Fish that eat smaller fish that have consumed a toxin - Barracuda, snapper, grouper, amberjack eat the smaller fish (ciguatera toxin -found in algae eaten by smaller fish)

Symptoms include reversal of hot and cold sensations.

Use approved reputable suppliers
Practice time and temperature controll
CANNOT BE COOKED OUT
