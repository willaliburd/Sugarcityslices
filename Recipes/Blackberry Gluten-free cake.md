#Blackberry, Pistachio, Olive Oil & Yogurt 
  

Dear friends,
Before I dive into this week’s cake recipe, I want to thank you for the overwhelming response to last week’s newsletter. I received so many messages from you sharing your excitement about the new recipes and letting me know you've preordered the book. Sometimes I struggle to find the right words to express how much your messages mean to me—but please know your support truly touches my heart. It allows me to keep doing what I love most and what I believe I was born to do: teach.
The Art of Gluten-Free Bread reached the top of the Amazon charts last week and became a best sellers for a few days. Publishing day is still months away but my publisher and I were blown away. 
I will be partnering with Book Larder for signed copies so if you want a personalized message, please consider purchasing from them. They are one of my favorite spots in Seattle and they ship all over the country- and the world! I will be doing my book launch event with them as well. We still don’t have an event calendar but I will share that once it’s all locked in.
Many of you have asked if I have a preferred bookseller. The truth is, I love independent bookstores. They are such important gathering spaces in our communities. I love walking into a bookstore, chatting about titles, and hearing the shopkeepers’ recommendations. Bookstores feel like safe havens in a chaotic world. If your local bookstore doesn’t carry my books yet, please consider asking them to stock them!
If you’ve preordered, be sure to hold onto your receipt—we’ll be sharing bonus recipes and content soon. I’ll have more details for you shortly.
And now, today’s recipe: blackberries and pistachios in a classic olive oil and yogurt cake, with a hint of lemon and sweetened with maple syrup. I’ve made so many versions of this cake over the years. It’s inspired by the one my mom used to make, measuring everything with a yogurt tub. I’ve tweaked it here and there, but the foundation always remains the same.
As always, make it—and let me know how it goes.
Enjoy!

#Blackberry Pistachio Yogurt Olive Oil Cake
 This is a very simple quick bread or cake – a variation of the classic olive oil and yogurt cake that I have many, many times before. This version is sweetened with maple sugar and syrup but read below for notes:
-       If your oven is on the smaller side, place your oven rack on lower third. This will prevent the top from browning too quickly.
-       You can replace the maple sugar with light brown sugar and the maple syrup with honey. 
-       If using vegan yogurt, make sure it is thick. I like Cocojune as it is thick without many stabilizers. 
-       The xanthan gum is optional but it does provide a bit more aeration and structure to the crumb.
-       I haven’t tested it, but if you want to make this egg-free, I would use “flax eggs” but bake it in an 8-inch (20 cm) square pan. I’m pretty certain it will work. I also believe 100 grams of applesauce would do the trick too.
-       I used fresh blackberries as frozen ones sometimes are too wet and can make the cake too soggy. 
-       I didn’t add any warming spices but I think ground ginger would be nice here. 
-       If you want the cake to crack right in the center (especially when using xanthan gum), run a butter knife through the top of the center of the cake. This will create an area for cake to expand and crack from, similar to slashing bread. It’s a more controlled way to direct the crack that will inevitably happen.
 
##Makes one cake
 
125 grams superfine brown rice flour
100 grams superfine almond flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum (optional)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3 large eggs
100 grams maple sugar
100 grams Greek-style yogurt (see headnote)
100 grams extra-virgin olive oil
80 grams maple syrup
1 teaspoon finely-grated lemon zest
150 grams blackberries
50 grams pistachios, coarsely chopped
40 grams light brown sugar
Flaky sea salt
 
·      Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease the inside of a loaf pan and line with a strip of parchment paper so it overhangs. 
·      In a large bowl, stir together the brown rice flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum (if using), and salt. Break up any almond flour clumps with your hands. 
·      In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, yogurt, olive oil, maple syrup, and lemon zest until smooth. Pour into the dry ingredients and fold until all flour has been incorporated. Fold in the blackberries. Pour this mixture into the prepared pan.
·      In a small bowl, toss together the pistachios, brown sugar and pinch of flaky salt. Sprinkle this all over the top of the cake. Run a butter knife through the middle of the cake (see headnote).
·      Bake for 55 to 65 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If your cake is getting too brown on top, tent with a piece of aluminum foil. Let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes then lift out of the pan using the parchment. Let the cake cool for another 20 minutes before slicing. Store tightly wrapped so it stays moist.
