*Equipment*

    Insulated Baking Sheet
    Pastry Blender
    Pastry Brush
    French Rolling Pin
    Bench Scraper

*Ingredients*

    ▢ 2 cup all-purpose flour (274 g)
    ▢ 1 tablespoon baking powder (13 g)
    ▢ ¼ teaspoon baking soda
    ▢ ⅓ cup granulated sugar (67 g)
    ▢ ½ teaspoon kosher salt
    ▢ 4 oz unsalted butter (cold & cubed, 113 g)
    ▢ 1 large egg
    ▢ ⅔ - ¾ cup buttermilk (or enough to fill 1 cup including the egg)
    ▢ ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
    ▢ ½ teaspoon pure almond extract
    ▢ 7 oz almond paste (or 1 batch of homemade almond paste)
    ▢ 2 tablespoon sliced almond
    ▢ Extra sugar for sprinkling
    ▢ Extra flour for rolling


*Instructions*

    Chop the almond paste into small chips, store in a bowl and set aside.
    Sift flour, baking soda and baking powder into a large mixing bowl, add kosher salt and sugar, whisk to combine.
    Add cold cubed butter to the flour mixture, work the butter into the flour with your fingertips or a pastry blender until all the butter pieces are about pea and lima bean size.
    Add egg, buttermilk, vanilla extract and almond extract to a measuring cup to fill 1 cup, whisk to combine. Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture and pour in the liquid mixture, reserving 2 tablespoons to use as egg wash later. Fold with a spatula or wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
    Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board, pat the dough out to about ½” thick and fold it over itself. Do this a few times to create layers. Shape into a rectangle.
    With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to about ¼” thick and 12” - 14” long. Sprinkle the chopped almond paste evenly over the dough. Roll the dough into a log starting at the long edge. Then pat it down to about 1” - 1 ½” thick. Cut into 8 triangles.
    Place the scones on a parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate or freeze for about 15 minutes while you preheat the oven to 400°F.
    Before you put the scones into the oven, brush the top and sides with the reserved egg wash, sprinkle with some sliced almonds and a little bit of granulated sugar for shine.
    Bake for 21-22 minutes until golden brown.
    Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet 5 - 10 minutes before transferring the scones to the wire rack to cool completely. Best served warm.


*Notes*

    Use an insulated baking sheet or a lighter color baking sheet to avoid the bottom of the scones getting burned.
    Refrigerating or freezing the scones before baking will help them keep their shape and rise taller instead of spread during the baking process.
    This almond scone recipe yields 8 generous size scones, or you can make a dozen smaller scones. Bake the smaller scones at the same oven temperature but reduce the baking time to 15 minutes.
