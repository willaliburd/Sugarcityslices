# Low Glycemic, Gluten-Free Coconut Bake

A healthier adaptation of traditional coconut bake that's both gluten-free and low glycemic.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups almond flour
- 1½ cups coconut flour
- 3 tsp gluten-free baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- 4 tsp (2 oz) cold coconut oil
- 1½ cups coconut milk (approximately)
- Optional: 1 tbsp ground flaxseed for better binding

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Sift almond flour, coconut flour, and gluten-free baking powder together in a large bowl.
3. Add salt and mix well.
4. Add cold coconut oil and rub into the flour mixture with your fingertips until it resembles fine crumbs.
5. Gradually add coconut milk, mixing until a soft dough forms. You may need to adjust the amount of liquid as coconut flour absorbs more moisture than regular flour.
6. Form the dough into a round disc about 1-inch thick.
7. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
9. Allow to cool slightly before serving.

## Notes

- This modified version will have a denser texture than traditional coconut bake.
- The dough may be slightly more crumbly due to the absence of gluten, but the coconut milk and optional flaxseed help bind it together.
- Serves 8.
- Perfect as a side for fish or curry dishes, or enjoyed with butter and your favorite low-sugar jam.

## Storage

Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer storage.
