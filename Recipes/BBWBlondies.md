Ingredients
Scale
For the Blondies:

    1 stick unsalted butter
    1 cup dark brown sugar
    1 large egg
    1 large egg yolk
    ¼ cup whiskey or bourbon
    ½ teaspoon vanilla bean paste (or extract)
    1½ cups all-purpose flour
    1 teaspoon baking powder
    ½ teaspoon salt
    ¾ cup semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chunks or chips

For the Whiskey Glaze:

    1 tablespoon whiskey or bourbon
    1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
    1 cup powdered sugar (plus an additional ¼ cup, as needed)
    Splash of milk or cream, if needed
    Flaky sea salt, for serving (optional)

Instructions
For the Blondies:

    Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with parchment paper and spritz with nonstick cooking spray.
    Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and stirring or swirling the pan frequently, cook the butter until the solids have lightly browned and the butter smells nutty. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes.
    Add the cooled butter to a large bowl and stir in the dark brown sugar, whiskey, and vanilla. Mix well to combine and then stir in the egg and egg yolk.
    Stir in the flour, baking powder, and salt and mix until a dough forms. Fold in the chocolate.
    Press the dough into the prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the edges are set and golden and the center is no longer gooey. Cool the blondies completely before topping with the glaze.

For the Whiskey Glaze:

    In a bowl, whisk together the whiskey, softened butter, and powdered sugar until smooth and creamy. Add more powdered sugar, as needed, until a thick and spreadable consistency is achieved.
    Sometimes, depending on the weather that day or the brand of powdered sugar I am using, I will need to add a splash of milk to the glaze to get it the right consistency. Start with a teaspoon and add more if you need to.
    Spread the glaze evenly over the cooled blondies. If preferred, you can sprinkle the glaze with a little bit of flaky sea salt.
    Allow the glaze to set for at least 30 minutes before slicing into bars. I like to transfer the pan to the fridge so the glaze really firms up. This makes it easy to slice into neat bars.

Notes

    I recommend using dark brown sugar instead of light brown sugar for this recipe. The added moisture of the dark brown sugar will lend itself to that wonderful “chew” we all know and love about blondies.
    The whiskey glaze is optional here. It really drives home that boozy, whiskey flavor. If that’s not your thing, you can skip it. The blondies are still delicious without it! The glaze DEFINITELY adds a strong alcohol flavor – just a word of warning.
